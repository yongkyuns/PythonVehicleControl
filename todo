To Do:
    1. Visualization
        - Offline mode (playback)
            - Playback with experimental data (.mdf, .mf4, .dat import & formatting)
        - New items
            - How to make scene reconfigurable? 
                - Windows should automatically rearrange and change graph colors, in other words self-configurating
                    - What would be needed to do this? auto GUI and auto graph?
            - Multiple graph/colors with single Plot object

    2. Modeling & Control 
        - Path detection with poly-fit, instead of nearest-point search
        - Implement steering model 
        - Adaptive control with linearized model (variable velocity)
        - Tensorflow and RL experiment??

    3. Software & Distribution
        - Front-end development (GUI, tabs, widgets, interaction)
        - Matlab compatibility??
        - Unit test?

    4. etc.
        - Documentation
        - Code profiling
        - Efficiency & performance improvement
