To Do:
    1. Visualization
        - Separate pyqtgraph child classes into new file
        - How to abstract scene graph? (multiple cars, paths in declarative YAML?)
        - Offline mode (playback)
            - Playback with experimental data (.mdf, .mf4, .dat import & formatting)

    2. Modeling & Control 
        - Path detection with poly-fit, instead of nearest point search
        - Implement steering model 
        - Adaptive control with linearized model (variable velocity)
        - Tensorflow and RL experiment??

    3. Software & Distribution
        - Front-end development (GUI, tabs, widgets, interaction)
        - Graph display
        - Github update
        - Installation guide and dependency requirements
        - Matlab compatibility??
        - Unit test?

    4. etc.
        - Documentation
        - Code profiling
        - Efficiency & performance improvement
