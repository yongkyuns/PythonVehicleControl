# This file describes objects that are plotted in the visualization.
# You can specify objects that you want to instantiate in a structured format.
# Each visaul object must have a unique corresponding 'key', which can be used to write data to it.
# For example, Box object has position information that can be changed through Box.setData method in your code.
# By using object.setData method in your code for each frame, you can animate the objects in the scene.
# The plot objects are stored in visualizer.Visualizer.graph
# So to write to any of the object you instantiate below, you can use the following code:
# import visualizer
# def update_callback():
#   pass
# view = visualizer.Visualizer(update_callback)
# view.graph['car'].setData(x=10,y=10,z=0)
